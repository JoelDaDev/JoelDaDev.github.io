                <p>Why hello there! I'm Joel - the coder of computers, the writer of words, and the listener of songs.
                </p>
                <p>I work at Chick-Fil-A, attend my church twice a week, and serve on both the tech team and the service team.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I drink coffee, write stories, and program desktop applications. I use Arch Linux on my main PC, MacOS Tahoe on my laptop, 
                    and only use Windows for gaming.
                </p>
                <p>My current programming projects are:<br>
                <em>mDirt</em>, a Minecraft Datapack IDE<br>
                <em>Crossed</em>, a scheduling app designed specifically for churches<br>
                and of course my own Church's website!</p>
                <p>I am writing a dystopian fantasy mythological steampunk thriller (I know, lots of genres combined. It's gonna work. I hope.)</p>

                            <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Dystopian Fantasy</p>
                            <p><strong>Themes:</strong> Gods, kings, lies, political drama.</p>

                            <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong><br> Long ago, the world existed as a continuous whole. The ancient gods ruled openly from the Coalition, shaping reality not as tyrants, but as stewards of systems too large for mortals to perceive. Humanity lived beneath them, prosperous and dependant, never fully understanding the forces that sustained their world.

Between the gods and the mortals, were the lesser gods—The Miriad. They existed as the intermediaries, living amongst the mortals. They had less power, but more knowledge of the mortals themselves, and more influence over them. But they began to speak: of independence, of humanity’s right to rule itself. A generation of human leaders listened. They sewed lies, telling humanity that the gods were tyrants. Ambition grew, replacing the reverence that once stood.

The Divinity Engines were not created as weapons, per-say. They were devised as a way to bind the divine power, regulate it, and redistribute it in ways humanity saw fit. When the first god was successfully imprisoned, it was hailed as a great triumph. The act shattered the authority of the Coalition, and one by one the gods were captured.

The consequences were not immediate. For a brief time, the world seemed unchanged. Then the earth began to fall. Vast chasms tore open across the land. Rain ceased entirely. Rivers dried, crops withered, and famine spread fast. Millions died in a slow unraveling.

A civilization collapsed, humanity turned inward. Engineers and rulers constructed a single fortress city amid the chaos, concentrating remaining resources, machines, and imprisoned gods within its walls. When the city was sealed, the rest of the world was abandoned.

With their remaining strength, the captured gods enacted one final act. They summoned a great Fog and cast it across the broken world. The Fog swallowed the lands beyond the city, obscuring them entirely. It could not, however, penetrate the city’s defenses. What it did to the world remains unknown, but the common theory is that it ended all life it came across.

Over generations, memory hardened into doctrine. The Fog became the Shade. The city’s survival became proof of the Government’s righteousness. Five centuries passed. History ended at the Wall.

But one god was left behind. One god, trapped in an Engine in the midst of the Fog. The one god who broke free.

                <p>We live in a world filled with hate, anger, and division. Every day we see people tearing each other
                    down instead of
                    lifting each other up. But God calls us to a different way, a way of compassion and
                    humility.</p>
                <p>God calls us to love instead of hate, to be slow to anger, and to walk in humility.
                    When we live this way, we reflect the heart of Jesus in a world that desperatly needs His light.
